# Henna Studio on a Raspberry Pi 5 (port in progress)

The Windows `HennaStudio.exe` cannot run on a Pi (Linux on ARM). Henna Studio is Python, so a Pi version is
being made in stages; each must work before the next. The laptop version is not changed by this work.

| Stage | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Camera: build Intel RealSense v2.58.4 (same as the laptop) on the Pi, check the D405 streams and records | scripts ready |
| 2 | Pi version of Studio: `/dev/ttyUSB0`, Linux fonts, full-screen browser window, setup script, desktop icon | after stage 1 |
| 3 | Same tests as the laptop: unit tests, simulator, Home, scan position, hover run on the prosthetic | after stage 2 |

## Stage 1 (camera only - the CNC is not used)
Needs: Raspberry Pi 5 (4 GB is enough), 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm), internet, official power supply,
the D405 on a **blue USB 3 port**.
1. Copy the folder `raspberry_pi` to the Pi (for example download the repository ZIP from GitHub while signed in).
2. In a terminal on the Pi, in that folder:  `bash stage1_setup_camera.sh`  (about 1 hour; asks for your password)
3. Plug in the D405, then:  `~/henna-venv/bin/python stage1_camera_check.py`
4. Send back the lines after `=== STAGE 1 RESULT`.
